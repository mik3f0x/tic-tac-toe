Tic-Tac-Toe, with an option to auto-restart the game on completion

## Description

Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

Win status is determined by assigning an arbitrary int to each of the two players populating the board, as a two-dimensional array, with these values on each turn.

```
const x = 1
const o = 5
```

On each turn, a test is performed to find the sums off all possible winning triplets and see if any match the active playerâ€™s hard-coded int*3

```
function winTest(row, col, xo) {
    xo = xo * 3
    if (board[row][0] + board[row][1] + board[row][2] === xo) return true
    else if (board[0][col] + board[1][col] + board[2][col] === xo) return true
    else if (board[0][0] + board[1][1] + board[2][2] === xo) return true
    else if (board[0][2] + board[1][1] + board[2][0] === xo) return true
    else return false
}
```
